Four pillars:

Abstraction

Process of only showing certain details of a class to the user. Hide data which isn't relevant to the user.
Example would be not showing the in-depth details for the engine of a car to the user.


Encapsulation

Process of hiding sensitive data from the user and making sure they can't access the data directly but only through a
getter method. Also make sure that this information can't be changed except through a setter method.
Example would be not being able to access a customer's bank details/contact details.

 
Inheritance

Sub-classes can inherit methods and attributes from parent classes.
Example would be that a car and plane would inherit methods and attributes from a vehicle class. Both have wheels, engine
and a driver/pilot but they also differ massively.

 
Polymorphism

Allows a parent class to define a default method which can then be overridden in the sub-classes.
Example would be that an animal makes a default sound which can then be redefined in the individual sub-classes.
